### Char Driver creation steps
- Define user defined device structure
- Define file operation structure which links to file operation to driver defined file operation functions
- Define driver init function
  - Allocate chr_dev region and its major number can be extracted if required.
  - Allocate memory for user defined device structure
  - Initialise allocated memory in previous step
  - Initialise char driver (cdev_init)
  - Add char driver to kernel (cdev_add)
- Define exit function
  - release any allocated memory previously in driver
  - remove char driver from kernel (cdev_del)
- Define file operation within driver as per needs e.g.
  - open
  - release
  - read
  - write
  - llseek
  - ioctl
